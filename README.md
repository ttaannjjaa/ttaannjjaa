### Hello and Welcome, my name is Tanja

📌 always open to discover new interesting things to learn... and learning to code is an awesome journey :rocket:  
you don't see any contributions here the last year, but I was very busy climbing up the learning curve ⛰ in my current job I love - new topics include Typescript, playwright e2e, GraphQL and AWS
